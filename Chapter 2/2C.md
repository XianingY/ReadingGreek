The rhapsode is silent. 
And the captain says that the rhapsode is
saying nothing. 
And then the captain tells the affairs concerning Salamis

KYB:
	You are speaking nonsense (saying nothing), my friend, and you know nothing. 
	Therefore, you are not making the story most beautiful.

RAPS:
	What are you saying? 
	Why (on earth) do I not make the story most beautiful?

KYB:
	Listen, my friend. 
	For my grandfather was a Salamis-fighter, and often he tells me the facts about Salamis truly, but not falsely like you. 
	For perhaps you tell us some beautiful story, but my grandfather tells the actual deeds. 
	Therefore, keep quiet, and listen again, O sailors, to the beautiful deeds of the Greeks. 
	For in this way (as follows) my grandfather recounts the events of Salamis.

(The sailors keep quiet (maintain silence).)

	For the Persian fleet arrives and waits near Salamis, but we Greeks kept silence. 
	And when night comes, the Persian ships sail slowly here and there. 
	But at dawn (at the same time as dawn), a shout arises, and when the trumpet sounds from the rocks, fear at once arises among the barbarians. 
	For they hear the shout clearly now: 
		'O sons of Greeks, go! Liberate the fatherland, liberate your children, your wives;
		Now is the struggle for everything!'
