On the one hand, the ship is going towards the Peiraieus slowly.
On the other hand, Dikaiopolis and the sailors and the captain and the rhapsode converse with one another gladly.
And the ship is going past the Salamis now and the captain says:

> 'Why doesn't the rhapsode relate the naval battle about Salamis,
> and why doesn't he say what happens in the Persian Wars and how the Greeks and the Persians fight,
> and what deeds they undertake,
> and how many do they die?'

And the rhapsode relates the naval battle gladly.

KYB:
	And you, O rhapsode, you know many about Homer.
	And therefore you know many about the rhetoric (for Homer is rhetorical: is he not?) 
	Come now, come here and say to us about the Salamis events.
	For on the one hand, for there is the island of Salamis, on the other hand, we are traveling slowly along Salamis towards Athens.
	Tell us, then, about the Persian Wars and the sea-battle around Salamis, and our daring and the victory.
	For the Persians do not defeat us, nor do they enslave us. 
	Tell us what happens in the Persian Wars and how the Greeks and the barbarians fight, and how many fall.
	For you, O friend, know clearly the matters about Salamis, but the sailors know nothing.

NAY:
	Yes.We sailors know nothing accurately.
	Therefore we listen gladly. 
	But speak, O rhapsode, and make the story most beautiful.

RAPS:
	Yes, indeed. 
	For I always make my stories most beautiful. 
	Therefore, keep quiet, O sailors, and listen.
