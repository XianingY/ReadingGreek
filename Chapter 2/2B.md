	Sing! Goddess, of the destructive wrath of Xerxes, the god-like king; 
	so on the one hand, the barbarians are approaching the city slowly, 
	and on the other hand, the Athenians are at a loss and are afraid.
	For on the one hand, the army of the Persians is large, 
	but the Athenians are few; 
	and on the one hand, the ships of the Persians are many, 
	but the ships of the Athenians are few. 
	Therefore, great is the danger of the Athenians, great is the perplexity, and great also is the fear.
	Therefore, on the one hand, the Athenians offer sacrifices to the gods and pray much, 
	on the other hand, they embark quickly onto the ships and fight on behalf of freedom. 
	For freedom is a good thing.

RAPS:
	And finally the Persians arrive, but the Greeks fight. 
	For great is the daring of both the Greeks and the generals. 
	And in the sea-battle, how great are the shouts, how great the perplexities, how great the supplications to the gods!
	And finally, on the one hand, the Athenians conquer the Persian navy. 
	Οn the other hand, the Persians fall, and do not enslave the Athenians. 
	And the Athenians liberate Greece and save the fatherland through their daring.
	For excellence and daring always conquer both aggression and the superior numbers.
	 Thus, therefore, the salvation of the Greeks becomes secure.
