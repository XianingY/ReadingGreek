Thus, the ship proceeds slowly towards the harbor. 
But Dikaiopolis sees a certain torch in Salamis. 
Therefore the captain asks: 'From where is the torch?' 
And when he sees the signal, immediately he hurries towards the harbour.

KYB:
	(pointing towards the harbour)
	Come here, you, and look! 
	For we are already arriving at the harbour.

DIK:
	_(He looks towards Salamis)_ 
	Look there, O captain. 
	I see a certain torch (light) on the island.

KYB:
	What are you saying? 
	Where is the torch coming from?

DIK:
	From where? 
	Look there!

KYB:
	(The captain also looks towards the island)
	O Zeus! For you do not see a lamp, but the fires.
