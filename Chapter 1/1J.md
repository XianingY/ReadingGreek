DIK:
	Therefore, are the rhapsode's skill and the general's skill one and the same skill?

RAPS:
	They are one and the same skill, oh Dikaiopolis.

DIK:
	And are good rhapsodes not good generals at the same time therefore?

RAPS:
	Yes, oh Dikaiopolis.

DIK:
	And are you the best rhapsode of the Greeks?

RAPS:
	Yes indeed, oh Dikaiopolis.

DIK:
	Therefore are you, oh rhapsode, the best general of the Greeks?

RAPS:
	Of course.

DIK:
	What do you say, oh sailor? Is the rhapsode stupid or not?

NAG:
	By Zeus, the rhapsode is yes indeed stupid, oh Dikaiopolis.
	On the one hand, for of course the man is the best general of the Greeks, but he doesn't know closely whether the ship is 'black' or 'swift' or 'hollow'.
	Therefore the best general of the Greeks is stupid.

RAPS:
	It is obvious, oh Dikaiopolis, and that Socrates plays jokes at me.
	For Socrates always plays jokes at the students in this way.

DIK:
	Yes. The Greeks are always children.
