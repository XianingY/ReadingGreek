KYB:
	But is our ship safe, and are we safe?
	Why don't I go down and look around closely?
	For I the captain: therefore the task is mine, and our safety is in my hands.

(The captain goes down and makes an examination.
And Dikaiopolis stays above.)

DIK:
	Now, oh Poseidon, save us to the harbour.
	On the one hand, for we always sacrifice sacrifices to you, on the other hand, you always save the fellows out of the sea.
	And now we are dying badly: On the one hand, for our ship is sinking into the sea clearly, on the other hand, our life-boat goes away clearly, and our safety is assured.

(The captain comes up.)

KYB:
	Be quiet! Oh Dikaiopolis.
	On the one hand, for our ship is safe, and on the other hand, we are safe.
	Therefore we are not in danger.
	And moreover the harbour is nearby.
	Therefore our safety is assured.
