On the one hand, Hegestratos runs off from below, on the other hand, the sailors help and chase Hegestratos.
Sdenothemis stays above.
On the one hand, Hegestratos looks towards Sdenotemis, on the other hand, Sdenotemis (looks) towards the sailors.
For the sailors are coming up and chasing.

ZHN:
	But what are you doing, oh Hegestratos?

HG:
	Look, the sailors are chasing me, oh Sdenotemis!
	And I am off.
	Don't stay, but you also run off, and throw yourself out of the ship.
	For the men are coming up now.

ZHN:
	Oh dear! (For) I see the sailors clearly.
	And where are you running away?

HG:
	I at least run off into the sea.
	(For) the life-boat is on the sea.
	Then you come up, save yourself!
	Throw yourself into the sea, and don't stay!
