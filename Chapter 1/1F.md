Hegestratos and Sdenotesmis don't stay but run away.
(For) the fellows throw themselves into the sea, and they look for the life-boat.
And (on the one hand), the sailors see their flight from the ship clearly, (on the other hand), the captain lets the lofe-boat go.
(And) the life-boat goes away from the ship.

ZHN:
	Alas, where is the life-boat?
	Where is it, oh Hegestratos?

HG:
	I don't see the life-boat, oh Sdenotemis - alas.

ZHN:
	We are dying, oh Hegestratos.
	Help, oh sailors, help.

HG:
	Im dying-

DIK:
	Do you see the fellows, oh captain?
	For the fellows are dying.
	(For) the life-boat goes away from the ship clearly.

KYB:
	Don't worry: For the fellows are bad, oh Dikaiopolis, and they are dying badly.
