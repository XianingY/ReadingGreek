ZHN:
	Come here, oh Dikaiopolis, and look!
	For I see the Acropolis.
	And do you see the Acropolis?

DIK:
	Where is the Acropolis?
	For I don‘t see the Acropolis.

ZHN:
	Come here, and look! Don‘t you see the Parthenon?

DIK:
	Yes. And for I see the Acropolis now.

ZHN:
	Oh Zeus. How beautiful the Parthenon is, and (how) beautiful the Acropolis (is).

KYB:
	You are telling the truth, oh Sdenothemis.
	Listen, a noise.
	What do you hear?
	What is the noise?
	And do you hear the noise, oh Sdenothemis?

ZHN:
	By Zeus, no,I hear nothing, oh captain.
	Don’t worry.
	But come here and see.
	For I see the naval dockyard and the Peiraieus.
	And do you see the naval dockyard?

KYB:
	Yes.

ZHN:
	Oh, Zeus, how beautiful the naval dockyard is, and (how) beautiful the Peiraieus (is).

KYB:
	You are telling the truth, oh Sdenothemis.
	Here!(There is) a noise.
	For I at least hear the noise again.

DIK:
	And I hear the noise again, oh captain, clearly.
	Therefore you and I hear the noise.
