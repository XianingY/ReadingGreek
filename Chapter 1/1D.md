Therefore, on the one hand, the captain goes down, on the other hand, both Dikaiopolis and the sailors go down.
For the noise is from below. And both the captain and the sailors see Hegestratos below.
Hegestratos is making the noise below.

KYB:
	Hey, you, what are you doing?
	But what are you doing, oh Hegestratos?
	What is the noise?

HG:
	I am doing nothing, oh captain, and I don‘t hear any noise.
	Don’t worry.

DIK:
	Come here and look, oh captain.
	For Hegestratos is holding something in his right hand.

KYB:
	What is holding in your hand, oh Hegestratos?

HG:
	I at least am holding noting, oh (my) friends.

DIK:
	Oh Zeus.
	For Hegestratos is not telling the truth.
	For Hegestratos is holding an axe in his right hand.
	The fellow is sinking the ship.

KYB:
	What are you talking, oh Dikaiopolis?
	Hegestratos is sinking the ship?
	But why don't you catch the fellow, oh (my) sailors?
	Here, here!

HG:
	Oh dear, I at least am off, and I am throwing myself from the ship.

KYB:
	Help, oh (my) sailors, help and give chase!
