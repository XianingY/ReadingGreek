Therefore the captain steers the ship towards the harbour.
And a sailor asks where the captain is.
For the sailor don't know clearly where he is: for it is night.
Therefore the captain says that they sail into the harbour.
And a rhapsode is in the ship.
And the rhapsode always quotes Homer.
And Dikaiopolis jokes at the rhapsode like Socrates jokes at his students.

NAY:
	Where are we, oh captain?
	Do you know?
	For I at least don't know clearly.
	For I see nothing because of the night, and I don't know where we are.


KYB:
	I know clearly.
	For we are sailing towards the harbour, oh sailors.


RAPS:
	'And we are sailing over the wine-faced sea.'


NAY:
	What does the fellow say?


DIK:
	It is clear that the fellow quotes Homer.
	Therefore he is a rhapsode.


RAPS:
	You are telling the truth, oh my dear chap:
	'And we are sailing in a black ship.'


DIK:
	What are you saying, oh rhapsode?
	What is this 'in a black ship'?
	For our ship is not black.
	It is clear that you are stupid, and you know noting, but you jokes at us.


RAPS:
	Be quiet.
	We are sailing 'in a swift ship', 'in a hollow ship'.


DIK:
	Don't you hear, oh sailors?
	Come here and listen.
	It is clear that our rhapsode is stupid.
	For the fellow knows nothing, but he is joking at us.
