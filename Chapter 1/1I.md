RAPS:
	But on one hand, I am not stupid, on the other hand, I know many things.

DIK:
	How many things do you know?
	It is rather clear that you are an ignoramus, oh rhapsode.
	For you don't know whether our ship is 'black' or 'swift' or 'hollow'.

RAPS:
	By Zeus, no, I am not an ignoramus about Homer.
	For I know many because Homer knows many.
	For Homer knows tasks of war and the naval matters and the soldiering and the generalship-

DIK:
	Therefore, and do you know the generalship?

RAPS:
	Of course. For my task.

DIK:
	What next? Are you experienced about the generalship, oh rhapsode?

RAPS:
	Yes. On the one hand, for Homer is experienced about the generalship, and on the other hand, I am experienced.
